# Data visualization with seaborn

This repository contains my first approaches in the field of _Data visualization in Python_. 

More specifically, the library I decided to practice with is **_Seaborn_**, a powerful but easy-to-use data visualization tool.

Here I'm gonna upload all my scripts and projects, in order to see, hopefully, my progress over time

Directories:
